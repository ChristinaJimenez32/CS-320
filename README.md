How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, I start with planning, this includes analyzying the needs of the clients and compiling a list of clear requirements. I implement best practices such as input validation, encryption, and regular code reviews. Rigorous testing, including unit, integration, and security testing, is essential to catch potential issues early on, and esnuring the code is secure and fucnitonal. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program requires effective communication with clients. Thorough meetings are required to gathers client requirements and follow up clarification may be requested in order to gather detailed requirements. Translating these needs into clear, actionable features ensures the program aligns with their expectations, and that each feature is implemented correctly and thoroughly tested.

How do I approach designing software?
When approaching software design, I begin with a clear understanding of the problem  and the clients needs and goals. I then define the software's architecture, considering scalability, maintainability, and security. I break down tasks based on features and make sure to follow best practices such as constant testing, documentation, and keeping scalibility and adaptivity in mind while coding.
